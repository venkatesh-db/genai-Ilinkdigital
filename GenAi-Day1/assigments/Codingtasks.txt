üìù Python Assignments (10 Questions)

1. Async API Simulation

Write an async function to fetch AI model outputs from 3 simulated APIs concurrently using asyncio. Print all results in order.

Concepts: async/await, asyncio.gather

Bonus: simulate random delay and exception handling.

2. Inheritance & AI Models

Create a base class AIModel with attributes name and accuracy.

Create two subclasses: ChatModel and EmbeddingModel

Each subclass should have its own run() method demonstrating polymorphism.

Test by creating an array of mixed model objects and calling run() on each.

3. Polymorphic Pipeline

Implement a Runnable interface (abstract base class) with invoke() method.

Create 3 subclasses: Summarizer, SentimentAnalyzer, KeywordExtractor.

Run them on a sample text polymorphically and print outputs.

4. Operator Overloading

Implement AIModel class with accuracy attribute.

Overload <, >, and == operators to compare models based on accuracy.

Create a list of 5 models and sort them by accuracy descending.

5. Array of Objects + Conditions

Create a list of AIModel objects.

Filter all models with accuracy > 90 and name starting with "G".

Print filtered models using a loop.

6. Decorator for Logging AI Tasks

Write a decorator log_task that logs: start time, end time, function name, arguments.

Apply it to two AI tasks: generate_summary(text) and analyze_sentiment(text).

Bonus: write logs to a file.

7. Lambda & List Comprehension

Given a list of text prompts, use list comprehension and a lambda function to:

Count number of words per prompt

Filter prompts containing the word "AI"

8. Async + File I/O

Create 3 async functions that write simulated AI responses to 3 different files concurrently.

Use asyncio.gather() to write all files at once.

Bonus: after writing, read all files asynchronously and print content.

9. String Methods + Data Cleaning

Given a list of AI-generated raw texts (with extra spaces, uppercase, and punctuation):

Clean all texts using string methods (strip(), lower(), replace())

Filter texts containing the word "genai"

Store cleaned texts in a new list

10. Combined Assignment (Advanced)

Create a small AI pipeline class:

Attributes: models (array of AIModel objects), data (list of texts)

Methods:

run_all() ‚Äî runs all models on all data async

filter_high_accuracy(threshold) ‚Äî filters models by accuracy

log_results() ‚Äî uses a decorator to log each model‚Äôs output

Test with 3 models and 5 texts, and demonstrate filtering, async execution, and logging.
